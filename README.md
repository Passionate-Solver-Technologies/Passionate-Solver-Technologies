# Passionate-Solver-Technologies
Our Mission is to bring Technology and Passion to solve problems for our customer. 

- We are focused on Indian Industries and want to solve problems at scale, combining both matured and emerging technologies. Our design led approach is about challenging the status quo and getting to the root of the problem to see what the solution could be. Traditional approach for the Industry has been to take an off the shelf product and create the solution around it often not investing enough to pinpoint the problem.

- The right calibration of Industry 4.0 in the context of the Industry and applying it to the problem at hand needs passion and focused attention. We believe ubiquitous frugal computing at the edge, cloud and at consumption point combined with the very accessible data science and analytics brings this tipping point to the industry. It is up to our imagination how we create composites of these in the form of IoT or Augmented Reality or Intelligence in Control to solve specific problems and discover new value.

- Every business needs to rediscover itself with a Remote Business Model not only due to the situation pandemic has thrust upon us but to flourish by delivering more value on real-time. The end customer and the human in the loop both have higher expectations and we see this a great opportunity for Indian Industry to Innovate. We are keen to partner in the journey.
